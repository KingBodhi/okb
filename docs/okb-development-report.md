# Office of the Oklahoma Billionaire — Development Trajectory Report (2026)

## 1. Purpose & Context
- Establish a unified strategy for leveraging the oklahomabillionaire.com domain in 2026 as the digital nerve center of the single-family office serving Jessy Artman.
- Align political, tribal, philanthropic, and commercial interests around a compliant, clearly messaged entity stack that honors the Oklahoma trust’s generational assets and partnerships with the Osage Nation.
- Deliver artifacts (maps, matrices, checklists) that leadership can use to brief counsel, designers, and operating partners.

## 2. Present-State Snapshot
### 2.1 Legacy Assets & Trust Structure
- **Oklahoma Generational Trust:** Holds land, energy, and legacy businesses; fiduciary duty to Jessy Artman family line.
- **Political/Tribal Relationships:** Active dialogues with U.S., Oklahoma state, and Osage Nation stakeholders for governance innovation.
- **Digital Platform:** oklahomabillionaire.com currently a light marketing presence, slated for aggressive expansion in 2026.

### 2.2 Active Operating & Affiliated Entities (2025 view)
| Entity | Type | Core Mandate | Ownership / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Office of the Oklahoma Billionaire (OKB) | Proposed single-family office LLC | Steward trust assets, run shared services, capital allocation, compliance | Wholly owned/controlled by Jessy Artman & trust
| PCG | Operating business | Commercial ventures (details TBD) requiring centralized oversight | Subsidiary/managed entity under OKB
| Fine Art Society | Cultural/luxury brand | Elevate fine art + blockchain experiences | Subsidiary/managed entity under OKB
| Emergence Institute | Nonprofit (501(c)(3) now, option to add 501(c)(4)) | Civic innovation, governance competitions, tribal partnerships | Affiliated but separately governed; services agreement with OKB
| Governance Challenge Platform (new) | Program under Emergence Institute | Facilitates competitions in governance & civic tech | Co-branded with Osage Nation partners

## 3. Strategic Positioning Options Considered
1. **Pure Family Office:** OKB strictly manages assets for Jessy Artman. Pros: regulatory clarity, privacy. Cons: limits public-facing civic posture.
2. **Political/Civic Platform:** OKB operates like a governance accelerator. Pros: aligns with competitions mandate. Cons: blurs fiduciary lines, heightens compliance risk.
3. **Dual-Track Platform (Recommended):** Parent family office plus affiliated nonprofit/policy arms with clean separation, shared brand narrative, and explicit service agreements.

## 4. Recommended Entity Stack & Governance Guardrails
```
Oklahoma Generational Trust (Jessy Artman)
│
├─ OKB Family Office LLC (manager-managed)
│   ├─ Shared Services (finance, legal, comms, HR, strategy)
│   ├─ Operating Companies: PCG, Fine Art Society, future SPVs
│   └─ Investment Committee / Risk Council
└─ Emergence Institute (501(c)(3) + optional 501(c)(4) affiliate)
    ├─ Governance Challenges Program (with Osage Nation & civic partners)
    └─ Philanthropy & Policy Lab (fellows, grants, research)
```
**Guardrails**
- Maintain SEC family-office exemption (clients limited to Jessy, family trusts, wholly owned entities).
- Use intercompany agreements so the nonprofit reimburses OKB for staff support at fair-market rates.
- Establish distinct boards: Family Office Board (Jessy + trusted advisors) vs. Emergence Institute Board (include independent/tribal voices).
- Codify conflict-of-interest policy covering land use, tribal negotiations, and political spending.
- Stand up compliance calendar (Form 990, trust audits, tribal reporting obligations, campaign finance rules).
